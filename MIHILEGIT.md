# ULF
Ultimate Legendary Fantasy RPG

Test-run in VSCode console from Primor (uncomment if to allow window application) or publish with VS before running.

It is on a standstill as I am unsure if I develop further on spells (finish fighting before beginning crafting, adventuring and the rest), if I develop it visually on a normal game window or if I just push it into unity like a real game.

However the original ULF RPG is also at a standstill with the development of mechanics, therefore I have no way to develop the code before actually fleshing out the RPG mechanics first.
