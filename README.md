# ULF
Ultimate Legendary Fantasy RPG

Test-run the current version extracting the .rar on the root and running the asnd-alone executable.

It is on a standstill as I am unsure if I develop further on spells (finish fighting before beginning crafting, adventuring and the rest), if I develop it visually on a normal game window or if I just push it into unity like a real game on the plated 3D space.

However the original ULF RPG is also at a standstill with the development of mechanics, therefore I have no way to develop the code before actually fleshing out the RPG mechanics first.
